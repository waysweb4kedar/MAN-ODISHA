					<h1>A Few Words About Ourselves</h1>
					<p>Autism Therapy Centre, Bhubaneswar is the outcome of strong determination, commitment and sustained efforts of a few parents of children affected with autism. The centre was founded in August,2008 and has just completed two years. It functioned for some time in Sai International School and is presently running in Bhubaneswar Future School. During its short span of existence it has faced many problems and challenges, which it has overcome successfully-thanks to the timely support of well-wishers and the resolute determination of the parents.</p>

<p><img src="images/future_school.jpg" width="598" height="203" class="image">The Therapy Centre is managed by a trust called “Manage Autism Now (MAN)” since June, 2010. The trust has five trustees including the Chairman and creator of the trust, who also happens to be a parent of a child affected by autism. Presently its financial resources are limited to contributions by the parents of the special kids admitted in the Therapy Centre. Consequently there is a wide gap between the resources generated and the requirement of funds for running the Therapy Centre properly. Efforts are on to raise resources through individual donations to start with and also to approach philanthropic organisations and Government for grants.</p>
<p>Autism is a complex neurological disorder impacting the normal development process of the child. Its manifestations are:-impairment in social interaction, impairment in communication, restricted interests and repetitive behaviour. As yet one does not know for sure what is the cause of autism. Studies made so for suggest that autism is probably caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p>

<p>It is true that children do not outgrow autism, or in other words it may not be possible to overcome all the impairments of the faculties of a human being caused by autism. Studies show that early diagnosis and intervention lead to significant results.</p>
<p>Early detection is therefore extremely crucial for effective intervention in all cases of autism apectrum disorder (ASD).The Autism Therapy Centre, Bhubaneswar is fully conscious of this and is giving emphasis on creating public awareness in this regard, besides providing effective intervention to the special kids having autism spectrum disorder. Our intervention covers Behavioural Therapy, Speech Therapy, Social skills training, Yoga and meditation Therapy, Ayurvedic treatment, Sensory integration(S.I)Therapy, learning through computers and Alternative mode to develop communication skills.</p>

<p>The centre also provides referral service to parents/families and professionals who work with them. The aim of the organisation is to improve the lives of all affected by autism. The Autism Therapy Centre supported by the Parents Association under the control and guidance of MAN Trust is trying to do this by increasing public awareness about the day–to-day issues faced by children on the spectrum, and providing the latest information regarding treatment and education.</p>

<p>The Therapy centre and the parents association are immensely grateful to Future Bhubaneswar School for their moral, material and logistic support which facilitated the smooth functioning of the Centre enabling it to its objectives to a large measure. When the centre was in dire need of suitable accommodation, Bhubaneswar Future School not only made available adequate and congenial accommodation it also provided moral and logistic support for the smooth functioning of the centre.</p>

<p>Proper sensitisation and orientation of the therapist/instructors of the Therapy Centre is very important. Similarly creating awareness among the parents about the various problems of autism and the method of dealing with them is equally important. The Trust, besides managing the A.T.C., is organizing seminars, symposiums, workshops on various aspects of autism to develop awareness and focus attention on effective measures to handle the problems of autism. </p>
<p>For more focused attention and effective  supervision one Executive Committee  has  been constituted to oversee the activities of the <strong>A.T.C</strong>.</p>
